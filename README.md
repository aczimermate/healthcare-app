# Healthcare App Dashboard

A comprehensive healthcare dashboard built using Python, SQL, and Dash by Plotly to visualize patient demographics, appointments, and revenue data. The dashboard is designed as a general solution that can be customized for any company working in the private healthcare sector. The synthetic data is generated in Hungarian by default but can be configured for any language supported by the data generation script.

## Implementation Steps

The project involves several key steps, each showcasing different aspects of database setup, data modeling, and data visualization:

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Set up SQL Server using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
   - Create a normalized database schema with tables for patients, services, appointments, and billing.
   - Utilize the `create_tables.sql` script to establish the database structure.

2. **Data Generation**:
   - Implement a data generation script (`data_generation.py`) using the `Faker` library to populate the database with realistic synthetic data.
   - Configure the script to generate data in Hungarian or any other supported language, demonstrating internationalization capabilities.

3. **Data Retrieval with SQL**:
   - Write SQL queries to retrieve and aggregate data from the database.
   - Optimize queries for performance and scalability.

4. **Python Application Development**:
   - Develop a Python application using Dash and Plotly for interactive data visualization.
   - Use `pyodbc` to connect to the SQL Server database and `pandas` for data manipulation.

5. **Interactive Dashboard Creation**:
   - Create interactive graphs and charts, including trendlines and statistical analyses.
   - Implement user interface elements like date pickers and dropdown menus for dynamic data filtering.

6. **Deployment and Testing**:
   - Test the application to ensure it works across different environments.
   - Document the setup process for ease of replication and deployment.

This structured approach highlights proficiency in database management, data processing, and application development, providing a strong foundation for future enhancements.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: macOS, Windows, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **Docker**: For running SQL Server in a container
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

---

## Installation

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aczimermate/healthcare-app.git
cd healthcare-app
```

### **2. Set Up a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **3. Install Required Python Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Database Setup

### **1. Install SQL Server via Docker**

Running SQL Server in a Docker container simplifies the setup and ensures cross-platform compatibility.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Docker**:

   - Download and install Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Pull the SQL Server Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

3. **Run the SQL Server Container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd" \
   -p 1433:1433 --name sql_server \
   -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
   ```

   - Replace `YourStrong!Passw0rd` with a secure password.

4. **Verify the Container is Running**:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

### **2. Create the Database**

#### **Using `create_tables.sql`**

- The `create_tables.sql` file contains all the SQL commands needed to create the `HealthcareDemo` database and its tables.

**Steps:**

1. **Connect to SQL Server**:

   - Use a SQL client like **Azure Data Studio** (cross-platform) or **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** (Windows only).
   - Connect to `localhost` on port `1433` using the `SA` account and the password set in the Docker run command.

2. **Run `create_tables.sql`**:

   - Open `create_tables.sql` in your SQL client.
   - Execute the script to create the `HealthcareAppDB` database and all necessary tables.

3. **Verify the Database and Tables**:

   - Ensure that the `HealthcareAppDB` database and its tables are created successfully.

### **3. Generate Synthetic Data**

#### **a. Customize Data Generation**

- The data generation script `data_generation.py` can produce synthetic data in Hungarian or any other language supported by the `Faker` library.
- Modify the script to change the `locale` parameter.

```python
from faker import Faker
fake = Faker('hu_HU')  # For Hungarian
# fake = Faker('en_US')  # For English
```

#### **b. Update Database Connection Details**

- Update the connection string in `data_generation.py`:

```python
conn = pyodbc.connect(
    "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};"
    "SERVER=localhost,1433;"
    "DATABASE=HealthcareAppDB;"
    "UID=SA;"
    "PWD=YourStrong!Passw0rd;"
    "Encrypt=yes;"
    "TrustServerCertificate=yes;"
)
```

#### **c. Run the Data Generation Script**

```bash
python data_generation.py
```

- This script will generate synthetic data for:

  - Patients (in the specified language)
  - Services
  - Appointments
  - Billing

---

## Environment Setup

### **1. Create a `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store environment variables:

```ini
# .env file
DRIVER=ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
SERVER=localhost,1433
DATABASE=HealthcareAppDB
DB_UID=SA
DB_PWD=YourStrong!Passw0rd
```

**Note**: Ensure the credentials match those used in the Docker setup.

### **2. Install Additional Dependencies**

Ensure all required packages are installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Application

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` to view the dashboard.
